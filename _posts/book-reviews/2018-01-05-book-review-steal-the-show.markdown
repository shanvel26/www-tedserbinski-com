[Steal the Show](http://amzn.to/2EZwV1o) is about how to assume the right role and make a great performance in all aspects of life—especially in speeches, pitches, and interviews. What’s great about the advice is it applicable in all roles in life from spouse and kids to colleagues and employees to fans and followers.

The author, Michael Port, helps us “understand the there’s nothing inauthentic about emphasizing different aspects of our voice to fit the needs of the moment” (LeaderBox, Activation Guide). In other words, it’s ok to perform differently in front of different audiences and still be authentic to the core.

The book revolves around strategies and tactics to employ speech-as-performance. This helps leaders better connect with people across different audiences of all sizes, from 1 to 1000s.

## Recommendation

Only buy [Steal the Show](http://amzn.to/2EZwV1o) if this post resonates with you first.

The book can be a tough read in parts. The author’s ego comes out a bit too much. There are some good thoughts and strategies but it could have been written in half as many words. Check out my blog post for the cliff notes and only buy the book if this post resonates with you.

## Key Insights

- Communication is about connecting with people authentically.
- It can feel inauthentic to act differently depending on who the people are or what audience they form.
- This can lead to feeling like an imposter and self-talk of the imposter syndrome, something that I do suffer from.
- A mental model would be to think of each communication setting as a different role, much like an actor.
- Each role can be different to emphasize the right points to connect with the people in the audience (whether 1 person or 1000).
- Each of these different roles is authentic and collectively they make up one authentic person. They don’t all have to be the same to be authentic.
- Our true voice is consistent across roles but can be emphasized differently depending on the role.
- An audience can be a single person or 1000s of people. It could be my wife or kids, a keynote I’m giving, or a 1:1 with a startup CEO. The key is that during this time you’re trying to make a connection with the person (or people) on the other end.
- Think of writing as a way to organize our thoughts to maximize impact.
- Use contrast in communication to avoid falling flat.

## Takeaways to Implement

- Framing and organizing big ideas using different frameworks:
	- the problem / solution framework
	- the numerical framework
	- the chronological framework
	- the modular framework
	- the compare and contrast framework
	- the three-act structure: situation, conflict, resolution
- Evaluate my message / idea with these questions (pages 91-92):
	- What matters most to you? What are you passionate about?
	- Could this change some aspect of the world for the better?
	- What makes this personal to you?
	- What’s your audience’s relationship to the issue?
	- What happens without the change?
	- How will listening to you benefit them?
- Evaluate my bio
	- Revisit my bio for specific audiences
	- My website, talks I give, conferences, tailor bio to fit the audience
- Practice, practice, practice. I have anxiety about perfectionism and getting it right. Waiting till the last moment because it isn’t right yet is putting the fear first. Instead, I should iterate, iterate, iterate on the material early on, when it’s not perfect.
- Rehearse material — whether a keynote or a sales pitch to form the neural patterns aiding the subconscious in the delivery.
- When pausing during speaking, it’s a time to listen to the audience and react appropriately. It also gives the audience time to process what you just said.
- An effective bio is short and powerful.
- When writing talks, reference on pages 213-223 “The Cheat Sheet: The 50 Public Speaking Tips You Can’t Afford to Ignore If You Want to Wow Your Audience and Win Praise and Plaudits Every Time”.
- During audience Q&A, never say “that’s a great question” but reframe it “that’s the first time anyone has asked me that” or “that’s a different way to think about it” (pages 166-167).

- “Authenticity really comes down to this question: do you have the courage to talk about who you really are, not just show you want others to think you are?” (page 5).

- “What are my goals are what is my motivation to accomplish those goals?” (page 43).
