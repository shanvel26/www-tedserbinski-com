I get a lot of email. I mean a lot. Close to 100,000 emails last year.

And I try and read each and every email.

But it’s nearly impossible.

And responding to them all? Well, that is impossible. *(side note: to learn why, read [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People][1])*.

So which emails make the cut? Is there a secret for getting your email opened and a response?

Yes, in fact there is. And not just by me. The dozens of VCs I interviewed all agreed with what I’m about to share below.

So why am I sharing it? Simple. If more of my email came in this format, it would save me a significant amount of time, both reading and responding. I’d process more in less time. And founders, like yourself, would get quicker feedback, instead of the dreaded non-response.

Win. Win.

So, here they are, the 5 secrets for getting a VC to respond to your email.

## 1. Don’t misspell my name
Sounds simple, right?  You’d be surprised at how many emails I get where my name is spelled wrong.

I triple check the names of new people I’m emailing to make sure I don’t type their name wrong. Misspelling a name is not only disrepectful, but it also shows a lack of attention to detail. It's further magnified when you don’t know the person at the receiving end of the email.

> My rule: If my name is spelled wrong, I delete your email.

## 2. Don’t be verbose
The longer your email, the less likely I’m to read it. And even less likely I’ll respond. Don't send me something like this (and this is only the top half of the email from March!):

![Really verbose email][image-1]

Or, in mathematical terms:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Probability of me responding to an email:&#10;1/(word length of message)</p>&mdash; Blake Commagere (@commagere) <a href="https://twitter.com/commagere/statuses/321050822026874880">April 8, 2013</a></blockquote>

> My rule: If your email requires scrolling to read, I’ll delete it.

## 3. Have a clear ask
Ever gotten an email where the sender goes on and on but it's not clear what they are asking for? Or they bury the ask at the bottom of a super long email? Yeah, those are the worst.

> My rule: If you don’t clearly ask, I’m not going to take the time to figure out what you want. Delete.

## 4. Do something first
These are my favorite. Emails where the sender took the time (or plans to) do something to create value. A funny video? Donation to a charity? Get creative. This guy below did and I took the meeting:

*Ted, you are obviously a very busy guy.  But would you consider a $500 donation to your favorite charity for an hour of your time?*

> My rule: If you go out of your way for me, then I’ll go out of my way to respond to you.

## 5. Write with ethos, pathos, and logos

Lastly, you still need to convince me it's worth responding to your email. And a cold email can be the hardest. So practice and write with these [modes of persuasion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion) to significantly increase your chance of a response.

> My rule: If you take the time to craft a well thought out email, emotionally connecting me to a qualified and logical thought, I'll take the time to respond.

## Combining the 5 Secrets

As I went to publish this post, I received an email via [AngelList](https://angel.co/tedserbinski). This email perfectly combined all 5 secrets and was one of the best cold emails I've received.

I responded immediately to this email. And I've traded a handful of emails with Nate. I've resposted this email with permission of the author to share with others.
