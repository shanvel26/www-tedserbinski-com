Three years ago, Techstars Mobility opened its office in downtown Detroit at Ford Field. We began our mission investing and mentoring entrepreneurs from around the world building the future of mobility.

Since then, [we’ve invested in 33 startups from 6 different countries](https://tedserbinski.com/mobility-startups/), who have raised $45 million valued at over $200 million. This summer, we’ll announce 11 additional startups that we’ve invested in that will be part of our fourth class. We’ve built a burgeoning mobility community, with 359 active mentors spanning 143 organizations. We’ve facilitated 7,500 meetings between founders, investors, corporations, and government organizations. We’ve hosted over 3000 attendees across our Mobility Demo Day, held annually in the fall. Two of our investments have been acquired as well—[Bosch acquiring SPLT](https://tedserbinski.com/mobility/bosch-acquires-techstars-mobility-graduate-splt/) and [Hagerty acquiring Classics&Exoctics](https://tedserbinski.com/mobility/hagerty-acquires-techstars-mobility-graduate-classics-exotics/).

Today, I’m excited to announce we’re moving to the 7th floor of [WeWork Merchant’s Row](https://www.wework.com/buildings/merchant-s-row--detroit--MI), centrally located in downtown Detroit.

In partnership with WeWork and [PlanetM](https://www.planetmlandingzone.com/), we’re designing a community and space where the future of mobility will converge. We’ve also teamed up with [Oblong Industries](https://www.oblong.com/) to offer their visual collaboration technology, Mezzanine, in two of our new meeting rooms.

In addition to the new office, we’re also welcoming back several returning corporate partners and a few new ones for our fourth program. Techstars Mobility’s corporate partners work closely mentoring and supporting the founders going through our Mobility program.

We chose Techstars to partner with in this endeavor for two reasons: 1. Their proven expertise in selecting the best early-stage teams, and 2.
