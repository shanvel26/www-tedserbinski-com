## 100% Diverse Founding Teams

The 2018 class is our most diverse class of founders to date. Of the 11 startups, all 11 startups have diverse founding teams in regards to gender, ethnicity, or age. I’m incredibly excited to bring such a talented and diverse set of founders to Detroit for the summer.

The teams come from all around the world including Hong Kong, London, and across the United States. None of the teams come from Michigan.

With the diversity of teams comes the diversity of ideas. I define mobility as the movement of people and goods, spanning industries like automotive, transportation, supply chain & logistics, travel, healthcare, agriculture, and more.

The incoming teams have a range of business spanning autonomous single rotor drones to applying machine learning to pedestrian intent to a connected bicycle helmet now available in Apple stores.

To see these companies in action, join us on October 9 at the Detroit Institute of Arts, where will host our 4th annual Mobility Demo Day. We’re expecting 1000+ attendees from around the world again this year. **To join in on the fun (it’s free!), [signup here to be notified when invites open up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdTTmCVsf7sir8ZyOFZKdjqiIgJyDPFLwckf4YH0RJMWjtD7g/viewform).**
