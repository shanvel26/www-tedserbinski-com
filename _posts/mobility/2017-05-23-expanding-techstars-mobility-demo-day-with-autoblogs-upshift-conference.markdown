<h2 class="sub-title"><small>Save the date, Oct 18th and 19th in downtown Detroit: a 2-day event focused on startups &amp; innovation driving the future of mobility.</small></h2>

The largest single-day startup &amp; innovation event in Michigan, Techstars Mobility Demo Day will be coming back for its 3rd year on Oct 18, 2017. The event will take place at the <a href="http://www.dia.org/dft/">Detroit Film Theatre</a>, located inside of the Detroit Institute of Arts Museum. The 2017 class of startups from around the world will take the stage in front of 1000+ investors, automotive &amp; transportation industry professionals, community members, and family and friends.

In 2017, we are partnering with <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/upshift/">Autoblog&rsquo;s UPSHIFT conference</a> to form a 2-day event focused on innovation that is driving the future of mobility, automotive, and transportation. This will be the largest event in Michigan focused on startups &amp; innovation in the automotive and transportation industry. This will be the second year for Autoblog&rsquo;s UPSHIFT, which gathers innovators and thought leaders from Detroit, Silicon Valley and around the world for a day of presentations, panels, tech demos and networking.

The past 2 years, our Techstars Mobility 2015 and 2016 demo days have attracted over a 1000 individuals from all around the world to come to Detroit and see these startups changing the future of transportation. You can <a href="https://youtu.be/9R2p90Gmljo?t=13m51s">watch our full 2016 demo day</a> or our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el78Qj9dVBM">recap of our 2015 demo day</a>.

Techstars Mobility is the first North American mentorship-driven startup accelerator program to focus on mobility startups and technologies. We invest globally in startups building technologies and innovative business models that transform how people and goods move across all modes of transportation (including pedestrian). We invest $120,000 in 10-12 startups each year, bringing them to Detroit for 90-days to work hands-on with them to accelerate their company. In the last 18 months, we have invested in 22 startups that have raised $20M and are valued at over $100M. These startups have come from all around the world including Tel Avi, Dubai, Germany, Chile, Canada, and across the United States. The 2017 Techstars Mobility class will be announced at the end of July.

We have 10 corporate innovation partners for 2017 including Ford, Verizon, Honda, Next47 (a division of Siemens), Dana, Munich Re, and Michelin that offer mentorship and support.
