## Startup Success Stories from 2017
Last year, during the inaugural AutoMobili-D, 50 startups participated from all around the globe, including the U.S., Canada, Dubai, London, and Portugal. The technologies included artificial intelligence and machine learning, to autonomous and connected platforms, to infrastructure communications and security applications.

One of those startups was [Acerta](http://acerta.ca/), which offers an artificial intelligence platform for machine analytics, which provides OEMs and Tier-1 manufacturers with automatic and real-time malfunction detection and failure prediction. At AutoMobili-D, founder Greta Cutulenco met ZF Group, one of the largest global Tier-1 manufactures. ZF Group soon became a key customer, which helped Acerta raise a $2M investment seed round.

Nearly every other startup at AutoMobili-D told us they also received great customer leads and biz dev opportunities. Here’s some of the feedback we received from the founders of startups:
