## The Most International Mobility Class Yet
The incoming class of 11 startups are coming from around the world, including Dubai, Tel Aviv, Munich, Vancouver and across the United States. They are building technologies and innovative business models that impact how people and goods move across all modes of transportation.

On October 18th, we&rsquo;ll be hosting our 3rd annual Demo Day at the Detroit Film Theatre inside the Detroit Institute of Arts. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe4NM6gfQ15bcclA-gBMzxx6XCu3torVnwU68u7H2MZWQBnqA/viewform">If you&rsquo;d like to join (it&rsquo;s free) add your name to the signup form here</a>.

These 11 startups are joining a thriving startup ecosystem in Detroit. According to the new report by the <a href="http://michiganvca.org/research/detroit-study/">Michigan Venture Capital Association</a>, there has been a 50 percent increase in Detroit-based startups in the last three years. In the last year alone, $62M was raised by startups in Detroit, 28 percent of all statewide venture capital investment.

## Expanded Corporate Sponsorship
New this year, we&rsquo;ve added four new partners to our consortium: <a href="https://www.next47.com/">next47 (the independent investment arm of Siemens)</a>, <a href="http://www.bosch.us/">Bosch</a>, <a href="https://www.inmotionventures.com/">InMotion (powered by Jaguar Land Rover)</a>, and <a href="http://aaa.com">AAA</a>. The four new partners join existing partners Ford, Verizon, Dana, Honda, Munich Re, and Michelin.

Together, these 10 corporate partners are helping mobility entrepreneurs from around the world succeed in building businesses transforming the future of transportation and mobility.

In addition, we have partnered with Detroit-based gigabit internet service provider, <a href="https://rocketfiber.com/">Rocket Fiber</a> to provide our startups with internet that is up to 1000x faster than standard cable companies. This partnership will provide internet not only at our Detroit-based office but also at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/10/foundry-house-is-providing-free-housing-to-techstars-detroit-program/">Techstars Mobility Foundry House</a> where startups&rsquo; founders can live for free during the duration of our program.
