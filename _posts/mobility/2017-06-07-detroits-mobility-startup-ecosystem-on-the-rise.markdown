<h2 class="sub-title"><small>New Corporate Partners and Office Mates Team Up with Techstars Mobility Accelerator</small></h2>

I&rsquo;m excited to announce that we have brought on four new partners for the Techstars Mobility Accelerator in 2017: <a href="https://www.next47.com/">next47 (the independent investment arm of Siemens)</a>, <a href="http://www.bosch.us/">Bosch</a>, <a href="https://www.inmotionventures.com/">InMotion (powered by Jaguar Land Rover)</a>, and <a href="http://aaa.com">AAA</a>. In addition, <a href="https://mty.ai/">Mighty AI</a> is opening an office in Detroit operating out of the Techstars Mobility Accelerator office.

The four new partners join existing partners Ford, Verizon, Dana, Honda, Munich Re, and Michelin. Together, these 10 corporate partners are helping mobility entrepreneurs from around the world succeed in building businesses transforming the future of transportation and mobility. Over the last 18 months, we have invested in 22 companies from around the world, including the United States, Canada, and Chile. Those companies have raised over $20M and are valued at $100M. On July 17th, we&rsquo;ll be announcing our third class with companies coming from Tel Avi, Munich, Dubai, Vancouver and across the United States.

As we go into our third program, we have a proven model of combining entrepreneurs with corporations and capital to drive success and grow the local Detroit community in the process. <a href="https://mty.ai/">Mighty AI</a> is transforming the future of AI, offering Training Data as a Service for autonomous driving. Having raised nearly $30M from investors, including Foundry Group, Intel Capital, and others, Mighty AI sees the importance of being tied into the Detroit entrepreneurial community. Not only will they work closely with customers across Michigan, they will also actively mentor the incoming 2017 class. Mighty AI joins <a href="http://tedserbinski.com/mobility/strengthening-collaboration-between-startups-automotive-industry-in-detroit/">Oblong and Mapbox who both opened offices in Detroit</a> out of the Techstars Mobility Accelerator office.

According to the <a href="http://michiganvca.org/research/research-report/">Michigan Venture Capital Association 2017 Research Report</a>, the are 141 active venture-backed startups in Michigan, nearly 50% increase in the last five years. And since Michigan has the highest research spending-to-venture capital investment ratio in the country, Michigan is the ideal place to grow startups in mobility. In fact, <a href="http://joinlunar.com">Lunar</a> and <a href="http://splt.io/">SPLT</a>, part of the 2015 class of Techstars Mobility, both relocated to Detroit from NYC.

As we look to the next five years, I&rsquo;m excited that our program is operating at the intersection of Detroit&rsquo;s two biggest strengths: its automotive dominance and entrepreneurial resurgence. Our next celebration for the growing community will be our <a href="http://tedserbinski.com/mobility/expanding-techstars-mobility-demo-day-with-autoblogs-upshift-conference/">2-day demo day on Oct 18 and 19</a>.
