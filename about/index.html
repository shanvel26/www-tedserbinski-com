<h2>Hello!</h2>

<p>In 2011, I <a href="/detroit/the-entrepreneurial-gold-rush-why-i-moved-from-san-francisco-to-detroit/">moved to Detroit from San Francisco to create a legacy</a>. I'm proud to be one of the leaders of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/23/motor-city-mojo-the-startup-renaissance-in-detroit/">Detroit’s startup renaissance</a>.</p>
<p>I am an entrepreneur at heart. I enjoy building things and helping people. I consider myself a blue collar type of startup investor: I'm happy to roll up my sleeves and get to work.</p>

<h2>Startup Investor</h2>
<p>I am the Managing Director of <a href="http://www.techstars.com/programs/mobility-program/">Techstars Mobility</a>, the first US startup accelerator program focused on <a href="http://tedserbinski.com/mobility/defining-mobility/">emerging mobility technologies</a>. Previously, I was a Partner and founding team member of <a href="http://www.detroitventurepartners.com/">Detroit Venture Partners</a>, a $55M seed-stage fund that invested in 25 companies.</p>

<h2>Detroit Community Builder</h2>
<p>I'm also a big community supporter. I sit on the board of the <a href="http://michiganvca.org/">Michigan Venture Capital Association</a>, board of <a href="http://techtowndetroit.org/">Techtown Detroit</a>, and am the Midwest Regional Advisor for <a href="http://ventureforamerica.org/">Venture for America</a>. I also was the founding Chairman of the Detroit Executive Advisory Board of <a href="http://techweek.com/detroit/">Techweek</a>, an event I brought to Detroit in May 2014. This event attracted 2000 attendees in its inaugural year as the largest startup tech event in Detroit.</p>

<h2>Startup Co-founder &amp; Open Source Developer</h2>
<p>I began my startup career as a co-founder and CTO of ParentsClick. With the 4th largest social network for moms and the largest blog network for moms, <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/08/27/419-lifetime-networks-acquires-parentsclick-network-first-digital-acquisiti/">Lifetime Television acquired us in 2008</a>, 52 days before the market crash!</p>
<p>I owe much of my website building know-how to the open source project Drupal. For over 7 years, I developed and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drupal+m3avrck#q=site:drupal.org+m3avrck">contributed over 1000 code patches to the Drupal project</a>. I also was an early pioneer building enterprise-grade Drupal websites for Fortune 500 clients, including Sony, MTV, and Lifetime Television.</p>
<p>I started my engineering career after I graduated from Cornell University in 2004 with a B.S. in Computer Engineering.</p>

<h2>Husband and Father</h2>
<p>The only thing constant in a startup is change. I learned this first hand growing up in a military family and moving around every 3 years.</p>
<p>And now I’m starting my own family in Metro Detroit. I'm married to a <a href="http://katieserbinski.com/">beautiful girl</a> and we had our first son, Joey, in 2013. I’m active in my local community as a 3rd degree Knight of Columbus. I’m also a silver palmed Eagle Scout.</p>
<p>In the evenings you can find me enjoying a great glass of scotch or <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MiniWineReview%20%40tedserbinski&src=typd">wine</a>.</p>
